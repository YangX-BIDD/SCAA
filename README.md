## Project Overview

This project explores aneurysm progression using single-cell RNA sequencing data from different mouse models. It includes:
- Integration of scRNA-seq data across multiple batches.
- Identification of distinct cell populations.
- Investigation of cell-specific pathways and molecular mechanisms.
- Reconstruction of differentiation trajectories.
